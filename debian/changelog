  * about: collect system version informations from a plugin Since we
    can't access files on disk from qml, we need to do it with some cpp
    code. The backend is going to be used to collect some other
    informations later as well. .

  * sound: set extra strings as translatable.
  * storage: add the list of installed softwares (built with fake datas)
    The list is built from a xml model. We provide a static list for
    testing, the idea is to make click packages generate a similar index
    (through trigger or similar) later.

  * Hit accountsservice over D-Bus to get the "welcome" image.
  * Install the private library(ies) into
    /usr/lib/$DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH/ubuntu-system-settings and add this to
    the import path. This means that the modules aren't exposed to the

  [ Ken VanDine ]
  * Updated string for the orientation plugin to match the design .
  * Updated the color in the gps icon to match the others .
  * Added stub plugins for system-update, security-privacy,time-date,
    brightness, phone, keyboard, accessibility, and language. Also set
    priorities and form-factor where appropriate.
  * make the main window flickable .
  * Ensure contentHeight is set properly and cleaned up the plugins to
    be consistent. Changed boundsBehavior on the flickables to keep them
    from being draggable when the content is smaller than what is
    displayed.

  [ Sebastien Bacher ]
  * don't install the example plugin, it's useful as source example, not
    so much installed (especially since we have other working plugins).

  [ Iain Lane ]

  [ Sebastien Bacher ]
  * about: start work on the "storage" subpanel, that's a rough first
    version of the UI that will need tweaking and improvement but at
    least that's a base to build one.
  * settings: don't use frames around the plugin icons.
  * settings: use an icon from the mobile theme This way the launcher
    will have an icon on the touch image (which is the primary target
    for that code) .

  * about: Use text and unicode to create the Ubuntu logo .

  [ Sebastien Bacher ]
  * setings: set up for translations Use "ubuntu-system-settings" for
    the domain, better to namespace to avoid name conflicts since all
    the translation are installed in the same directory. The po.pro will
    make the translation be compiled and installed on build, there is
    also a "make pot" target to refresh the template. This commit also
    includes a first translation (fr.po) which was used to test that
    things are working correctly. .
  * settings: use the string capitalization style recommended by design
    Set some strings, like the vendor or model inforations, as not
    translatables since those should be local specific.
  * settings: make the plugin names translatable.
  * settings: update some icons with copies from design, we will replace
    those by theme icons once they are polished and included in the
    theme use a standard icon for the airplane-mode since it's already
    in theme .
  * settings: set the theme to ubuntu-mobile, until lp#1098578 is fixed,
    (toolkit not respecting the theme in use), recommends ubuntu-mobile-
    icons as well since we use icons shipped there. (LP: #1098578)

  * about: set an icon url rather than defining an image.

    horizontal lines.
  * reset: add new plugin for settings reset .
  * settings: tweak a bit the UI to be closer from the mockup, we are
    still having only a few panels available and are missing nice icons
    but otherwise it's getting there.

  * * Wrap the icons with an UbuntuShape, this makes it look more
    consistent with the shell icons. * Added a leftMargin in the
    CategoryGrid so the section titles aren't right against the edge *
    Make flight-mode a ListItem.Standard to be more consistent with the
    about plugin.

  [ Sebastien Bacher ]
  * settings: split the category grids from the settings in a new
    component Use the new component to list the 3 categories from the
    design, tweak a bit the UI to add category labels and some spacing .
  * about: tweak the UI to address mpt's review comments - use standard
    header items rather than custom - use a singlecontrol item for the
    button - tweak spacing of the first entry - fix a typo in one of the
    strings.
  * flight-mode: use an url rather than an image for the entry The image
    doesn't scale right for some reason, it's also easier to do it this
    way.

  * [shell] give a bit of extra height, the geometry is closer from a
    device this way and it also makes testing easier (no need to scroll
    to see the bottom of the panels).
  * Update the about plugin UI, that's a first rought implementation
    following the design on
    https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AboutThisDevice#Phone. The panel doesn't do
    much yet but that's a start.
