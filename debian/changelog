  * license: implement the "software licenses" section subpanel The
    current approch is to list all the packages installing a copyright
    and build a model from that. When selecting one of them in the list
    we go to a new page which displays the content of the copyright.
    That might need some tweaking later to include licences from the
    container .
  * about: improve a bit the format of the vendor header.
  * reset: use singlecontrol items, the margin issue has been resolved.
  * sound: implement the silent mode warning The UI is there but not
    plugged to the system yet, you need to manually set the variable to
    see it. .

    includes a first translation (fr.po) which was used to test that
    things are working correctly. .

    Set some strings, like the vendor or model inforations, as not
    translatables since those should be local specific.
  * settings: make the plugin names translatable.

    those by theme icons once they are polished and included in the
    theme use a standard icon for the airplane-mode since it's already
    in theme .

    button - tweak spacing of the first entry - fix a typo in one of the
    strings.
