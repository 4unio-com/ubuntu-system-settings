The System Settings application for Ubuntu Touch.

The upstream project is hosted on launchpad, the design on the Ubuntu wiki:
https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-system-settings
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SystemSettings

= Preparing environment =

You need to download source code with using command:

   $ bzr branch lp:ubuntu-system-settings branch-name
   $ cd branch-name

You need to install all necessary packages needed for build.
The easiest way to install dependend packages is to run command:

   $ sudo apt-get build-dep ubuntu-system-settings

Unfortunately some packages still could be missing (because we are working on trunk branch). 
The list of all requried packages is available at file: debian/control
You could install missing packages by using apt-get command. For example:

   $ sudo apt-get install libubuntu-download-manager-client-dev libubuntuoneauth-2.0-dev \
     libtrust-store-dev libupower-glib-dev libaccountsservice-dev libtimezonemap1-dev

= Building =

The build system uses CMake.
To compile, create "builddir" directory (to separate build artefacts from source code), 
invoke cmake generation process and start build :

   $ mkdir builddir && cd builddir
   $ cmake .. && cmake --build . -- -j 3

To speed up generation and compilation, you could use Ninja generator instead of Make:

   $ mkdir builddir && cd builddir
   $ cmake .. -G Ninja && cmake --build .

= Running =

To run application you need to install System Settings application first.
For Make generator:

   $ sudo make install

For Ninja generator:

   $ sudo ninja install

To run:

   $ system-settings
